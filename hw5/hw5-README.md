# Data Sets 

This assignment contains four data sets that are based on publicly available benchmarks:

1. **mnist1000.csv**: A data set of optical character recognition of numeric digits from images.  Each instance represents a different grayscale 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten numeric digit (from 0 through 9).  The attributes are the intensity values of the 784 pixels. Each attribute is ordinal (treat them as continuous for the purpose of this assignment) and a nominal label.  This version of MNIST contains 1,000 instances of each handwritten numeric digit, randomly sampled from the original training data for MNIST.  The overall MNIST data set is one of the main benchmarks in machine learning: [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).  It was converted to CSV file using the python code provided at: [https://quickgrid.blogspot.com/2017/05/Converting-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Dataset-into-CSV-with-Sorting-and-Extracting-Labels-and-Features-into-Different-CSV-using-Python.html](https://quickgrid.blogspot.com/2017/05/Converting-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Dataset-into-CSV-with-Sorting-and-Extracting-Labels-and-Features-into-Different-CSV-using-Python.html)

2. **penguins.csv**: A data set describing observed measurements of different animals belonging to three species of penguins.  The four attributes are each continuous measurements, and the label is the species of penguin.  Special thanks and credit to Professor Allison Horst at the University of California Santa Barbara for making this data set public: see this Twitter post and thread with more information [https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1270046399418138625](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1270046399418138625) and GitHub repository [https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).

3.	**energy.csv**: A data set describing the energy consumption in 10-minute increments by appliances in a low-energy residence in Belgium.  The task is to predict how much energy was consumed by appliances.  Each of the 27 attributes are numeric and describe measurements from sensors in the residence or nearby weather stations, as well as energy usage by lights.  This data set comes the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/374/appliances+energy+prediction](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/374/appliances+energy+prediction)

4.	**seoulbike.csv**: Another data set describing bike rentals in a metropolitan area (Seoul, South Korea).  Again, the task is to predict how many bikes will be rented hourly throughout the day over a two-year period.  The 11 attributes are a mix of 2 categorical and 9 numeric attributes, including information such as the season, whether it was a holiday, and current weather conditions.  This data set comes the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand)

# Research Questions

There are no research questions for this assignment to answer in this README.md.  Instead, your techical report will answer your research questions.

# Additional Questions

Please answer these questions after you complete the assignment:

GROUP MEMBERS: Mario Stinson-Maas, Josh Dawson

1. What was your experience during the assignment (what did you enjoy, what was difficult, etc.)?

We enjoyed applying the concepts we have been learning all semester. However, it was difficult to write the technical paper at the same time we were working on our final project and writing up that final paper.

2. Approximately how much time did you spend on this assignment?

14 hours

3. Did you adhere to the Honor Code?

Yes
