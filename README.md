# Welcome to an archive of my work in Oberlin's CSCI 373, Applied Machine Learning 

Stored in this repository are copies of homeworks 1-5 from my work in Applied Machine Learning in Spring of 2024, of which I received an A+.

Homeworks 2-5 were completed in collaboration with Mario Stinson-Maas, who can currently be found at `github.com/Mario730`.

Copies of all datasets used during the semester are stored in `Data`, and figures created from all homeworks are stored in the appropriate folder within `Figures`.

Inside each hw directory, there is at least one .py file, that was used to complete the task. Along with this, there are the data sets used for the specific homework, a results file/directory of some kind, and a README, which contains descriptions of the data sets used and my answers to the provided 'research questions.'

In this class, we covered k-nn (seen in hw1), decision trees and forests (seen in hw2), many regression approaches (seen in hw3), and neural networks (seen in hw4). For our hw5, we wrote up a technical report detailing our findings in comparing our supervised ML approaches on four different real-world datasets.
